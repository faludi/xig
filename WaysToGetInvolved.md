# How Can I Help? #

If you'd like to help the XIG grow there are many ways to get involved.  You don't even have to be a programmer.

Much of the success of any open project comes from the vibrancy of its community.  See below for ways you can participate!

# Ways to Get Involved #

Tasks for everyone:
  * Have you built something with the XIG?  Make a video or blog write up and [share it with us](http://gallery.digi.com)!
  * Give feedback: something missing or broken? Make certain to file an [issue](https://code.google.com/p/xig/issues/list).
  * Clarify, edit, contribute to the UserDocumentation

Tasks for non-programmers:
  * Create an instructional how-to video on a specific feature of the XIG
  * Write a blog entry about your experience with the XIG, XBees or ConnectPort gateways
  * Tweet to the world (and mention @xigproject) that you're using the XIG
  * Share the XIG at your local hackerspace

Tasks for programmers:
  * Create issues for code that isn't well commented
  * Create new sessions (e.g. TCP, telnet, FTP, mailto)
  * Write a tutorial on how to create new sessions with the XIG
  * Share code: if you've made an object which interacts with the XIG (e.g. a cool Arduino project) share the code with the world and we'll link from it here!
