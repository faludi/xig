The third in a series of video tutorials on the XBee Internet Gateway (XIG) project showing you how to stream information from XBee modules to Device Cloud's data store. Once on Device Cloud, the information can be queried in a variety of ways and retrieved in a variety of formats.

The XIG supports two methods for uploading data: either configuring an XBee to send I/O samples on its own--using the IR or IC AT configuration commands--or by sending specially formated URL strings into the serial port of an XBee which are handled by the XIG running on a Digi ConnectPort X gateway.
