ZigBee is a wireless radio technology built on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.  The Digi XBee Series 2 products are built to use ZigBee protocol.  ZigBee includes both a mesh routing stack (creating self-forming and self-healing networks) and an application stack which allows ZigBee devices to discover and use each other's services.
