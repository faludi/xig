The first in a series of video tutorials by the XBee Internet Gateway (XIG) project shows how to get started using the XIG to enable your XBee-based designs to access the Internet.

This video demonstrates where to get the XIG, how to install it on your Digi ConnectPort X gateway, and how to use an XBee to fetch web pages and abort long requests.
